The People's History of Los Angeles

Project Abstract:
This project seeks to illustrate, highlight, celebrate the stories and lived experiences of everyday
people living in Los Angeles. The project will do this by letting people tell their own stories via video 
of experiences that they have had in different parts of the city. These videos will be pinned to a physical
location in the city and will allow users to play those videos when they are near that location. Since the
stories can also be across time, in addition to across the city, the platform will have supplemental 
information to let users know the context of how Los Angeles was during the time when this story is being
told. 

Project Details: 
The first version of this platform will include 20 video stories of different people from across
the city -- 5 from the westside of L.A. (Santa Monica, Culver City, Westwood, West Hollywood),
5 from the northside of L.A. (Hollywood, Mid Wilshire area, Little Ethiopia), 5 from the southside of L.A. (
Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw, Adams), 5 from the eastside of L.A. (Downtown, Koreatown, East L.A.,
Echo Park). Each story will be geo-tagged and have an accompying video. 

Technical Details:
This will be a progressive web application, to save people from downloading yet another app. The browser 
has APIs that allow you access the camera and geolocation data, which is the main APIs that this application
will consume. We want the geolocation API so that we can pin stories to specific locations and the camera
API is needed because we will want to place custom QR codes around the city near places where the stories
take place. This will allow people to scan the QR code and jump right to the relevant video and supplemental
info for the story. They will also be able to browse other stories across that platform. We will most likely
have to take advantage of services that will allow streaming video.


Timeline:
The first version of the project is due by the end of November. 

Possible Obstacles: 
The main obstacles that this project will be centered around gathering interesting, varied stories of the
people of L.A. I suspect that some people will be reclutant to share good stories without having a previous
repore with the interviewer. Depending on the nature of the story, they may be reluctant to have their face
on camera, which will make the need for creative editing and/or animators in getting the impact of the story across to the 
viewer. The other obstacle will be in securing editors to work with video given to make a compelling piece.
This piece may or may not prove to be difficult but I include it to be throughouh.
